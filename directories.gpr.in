-- GNAT project files for packaged libraries need to point to architecture-
-- specific files in /usr/lib or /usr/lib64 (or other architecture-specific
-- directories). To work correctly in a multilib system they should import
-- this file and use the variable Libdir, for example like this:
--
--    for Library_Dir use Directories.Libdir;
--    for Library_ALI_Dir use Directories.Libdir & "/example_library";
--
-- Information on what the hardware platform is comes from the environment
-- variable HARDWARE_PLATFORM, which is defined in /etc/profile.d/ and can be
-- changed with the command "setarch" or overridden by a command line parameter.
-- It may be undefined in a non-interactive shell, so automated build scripts
-- should probably define it themselves or use the command line parameter. RPM
-- spec files should simply use the macros that are defined in macros.gnat.
